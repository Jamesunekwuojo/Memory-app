This is a fully SSR (Server-Side Rendered) app that provides a brief history of the top inventors of six popular programming languages. In this app, all the frontend code is rendered from the server.

During the course of building this app, I gained a solid grasp of the following:
 1. How to use the EJS templating engine to render HTML templates.
 2. Node authentication using JWT and cookies.
